## What's the objective?

It is a simple personal project called with "Kirian.h" in honor of the kitten Kirian.

The objective of the project is to create a challenge for myself, where I will develop a library in C to manipulate files at the byte level, creating a CRUD for structures

## Then there's a picture of Kirian
