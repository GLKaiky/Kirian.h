## What's my goal?

It is a simple personal project called with "Kirian.h" in honor of Kirian, the kitten.

The goal of this project is creating a challenge for myself, in which I will develop a library in C to manipulate files at byte level , creating a CRUD for its structure

## And here's a picture of Kirian ðŸ‘‘
